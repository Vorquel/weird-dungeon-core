So, it turns out I don't need to exhale. That's cool. If I just kinda hold my breath, the mana will integrate into me. That gave me an aura that let's me see everything a certain distance around me. Also I was deaf before. Who knew? The aura thingy lets me hear the goings on in the caves around me. I've seen people, so now I know how big I am. I'm somewhere between golf ball and tennis ball sized. Unfortunately, I have no idea what the people around me are saying. They can definitely use mana though. I can feel it against my aura. Seems like they can feel my aura too, but they can't feel it very well, and they definitely can't see it. Weirdest thing was when they first felt my aura, they seemed relieved? Whatever. I'm just going to continue mapping this mountain and eating all the tasty ores.

We finally found the dungeon. Or at least we thought we did, but then it left. I didn't think dungeons could leave. The core is obviously moving around somehow. It might be in a symbiotic relationship with a rock-worm or something. There is definitely less ore in the caves than before, but no sign of any monsters. Trap oriented dungeons seem like they would be better to some people, but at least you can feel monster auras coming at you. A completely mundane trap can go off before you even know what happened. No traps either though. This dungeon is weird. No monsters, no traps, and it somehow moves. Whatever is going on, it seems like low level adventurers should be safe here again.

The mountain is more or less mapped out. It's weirdly isolated for whatever reason. Shaped almost like a cone, but with caves running through it all over the place. I wanted to go down to the surrounding plains, but the mana is way lower down there. Don't know whether that's an altitude thing or just this mountain being special. It's funny because you would expect it to be easier to breathe down there. Then again, I'm not really breathing air, am I? Lots more people have been around lately. Not just humans either. Those are definitely dwarves I see. Neat. Also, I found goblins! They definitely weren't there before. Judging by the tents they're using, they seem nomadic though. The goblins seem to be avoiding the humans for the most part, which is nice. It always seemed contrived to me that having green skin gave you a hatred of everything else with two legs. I did see a human and goblin meet once. They both stared at each-other for a second before running in opposite directions. They are definitely afraid of each-other. I hope that's not a prelude to something bad.
