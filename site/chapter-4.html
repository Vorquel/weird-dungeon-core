        Ok, this is bad. I don't want my green little buddies to go around killing people. Can I stop them? They can definitely feel my mana. Maybe I can wiggle it around to get my point across. Ok, mixed success. The smaller one is backing off, but the bigger one is getting even more into it. Come on, I didn't choose to watch you so you could show me how good you are at killing people. Ok, decision time. Would I rather let my cute little angry goblin live, or a couple of innocent hikers. Yeah, it's obvious when I put it that way.

        More strange news from the dungeon. A couple of adventurers were walking up the mountain when they heard the sound of falling rocks, and saw a goblin running away. Taking a closer look, it seems that a stalactite fell directly onto another goblin, which was seen to be absorbed moments later. Judging from the crude weapons found next to the dead goblin, those adventurers very narrowly avoided an ambush. It is unlikely that the dungeon has such poor control over its domain that it let the spike fall accidentally. We can only conclude that the dungeon wanted to protect the adventurers. I'm hesitant to say that this has never happened before, but I certainly haven't heard of this type of mercy from a dungeon. I want to say this is purely good for us, but my instincts are telling me that there's more to this than I can see. I'll have to tell the boys to watch what they're doing around the dungeon.

        Wow, that was more than I expected. Time to collect my thoughts. First, that's the first time I've ever killed someone, and I don't feel any remorse or regret. I knew on an intellectual level that I'm not human anymore, but this is the first time that I truly felt inhuman. Second, it's a good thing I killed that goblin because that wasn't the first human hunt he had been on, nor would it be the last. I guess when I absorb the brain of someone who dies in my domain, I get to keep some of their memories and skills. Big boy had killed at least two dozen people in his short life. Also, now I know how to throw a javelin, which is cool, but not really something I can use. Furthermore, I speak goblin now. I don't remember what everyone was saying before, so I can't really translate it, but I guess it's time for me to visit the goblin camp again.
